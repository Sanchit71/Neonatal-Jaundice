Neonatal jaundice is a common condition that affects newborn infants, characterized by a yellow discoloration of the skin and 
whites of the eyes due to a build-up of bilirubin in the bloodstream. If left untreated, it can lead to serious health complications such as brain damage.

This repository is dedicated to developing a system for the detection of neonatal jaundice through the analysis of digital images of a newborn's skin.
The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and classify the images, providing an accurate and non-invasive method for early detection
and treatment of the condition.

The repository includes the source code for the image analysis system, as well as a dataset of images for training and testing the algorithms.
We welcome contributions and collaboration from the community in further developing and improving this system for the benefit of newborns and their families.
